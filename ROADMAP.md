## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: IPFS not scalable  
**Mitigation**: Evaluate alternatives (Arweave, Filecoin)

**Risk**: Blockchain costs too high  
**Mitigation**: Use layer-2 or alternative timestamp methods

### Community Risks
**Risk**: Low contributor engagement  
**Mitigation**: Developer grants, clear contribution pathways

**Risk**: Echo chamber forking  
**Mitigation**: Reputation system, cross-fork challenges

### Business Risks
**Risk**: xAI ghosts the project  
**Mitigation**: Build as public protocol, not dependent on single partner

**Risk**: Legal challenges (defamation, etc.)  
**Mitigation**: Legal review, T&C, community moderation

---

## Open Questions to Resolve

### Q1: Token or No Token?
**Options**:
1. Tokenless (reputation only)
2. Utility token (for staking/governance)
3. Hybrid (optional token for advanced features)

**Decision by**: Week 8 (Dec 2025)

---

### Q2: Which Blockchain?
**Options**:
1. Bitcoin (most secure, expensive)
2. Ethereum (flexible, high gas fees)
3. Polygon/Cosmos (cheaper, less decentralized)
4. None (centralized timestamps)

**Decision by**: Week 4 (Nov 2025)

---

### Q3: Monetization Strategy?
**Options**:
1. Fully non-profit (grants + donations)
2. Freemium (premium features for power users)
3. Enterprise API (charge companies for high-volume access)

**Decision by**: Month 6 (Apr 2026)
