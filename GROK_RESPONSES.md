## Timeline

### 9:34 AM - Original Thread Published
**Platform**: X (Twitter)  
**Author**: [@NomanInnov8](https://x.com/NomanInnov8)  
**Content**: 10-point technical critique of Grokipedia architecture

**Key points raised:**
1. Truth-seeking requires contestation, not passive consumption
2. Real-time data ≠ verified data
3. Bias replacement (left → right) doesn't solve bias problem
4. Proposed "Truth Mesh" concept: versioned, fork-able, no single authority
5. Need for provenance tracking and confidence decay
6. Formal challenge system with evidence requirements
