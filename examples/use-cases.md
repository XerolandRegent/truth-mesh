# Truth Mesh Use Cases

**Real-world scenarios where Truth Mesh adds value**

---

## 1. Scientific Retractions

### Problem
Study published → Cited by 100 papers → Later retracted → Citations remain, misinformation spreads

### Truth Mesh Solution
- Original study stored as Core Fact with DOI signature
- 100 papers link to it in Context Cloud
- Retraction notice triggers confidence decay
- All papers citing it show warning: "Source retracted"
- Users see timeline: "95% confidence (2020) → 20% confidence (2023 - retracted)"

**Impact**: Prevents zombie research from living forever

---

## 2. Political Fact-Checking

### Problem
Politician makes claim → Fact-checkers say "False" → Politician's supporters don't trust fact-checkers → Stalemate

### Truth Mesh Solution
- Claim stored as Interpretation (not Core Fact)
- Multiple fact-check organizations add their interpretations
- Each fork shows different perspective (left, right, academic)
- Users see bias tags on each interpretation
- Community can challenge with counter-evidence
- Reputation system shows track record of accuracy

**Impact**: Reduces "biased fact-checker" objection by showing multiple lenses

---

## 3. Climate Data Disputes

### Problem
Skeptics claim "data is manipulated" → Scientists say "data is public" → No resolution

### Truth Mesh Solution
- Raw temperature data stored as Core Facts (NOAA, NASA signatures)
- Multiple interpretations coexist:
  - "Data shows warming trend" (mainstream science)
  - "Data shows natural variability" (skeptic view)
  - "Data quality issues need addressing" (methodological critique)
- Each interpretation links to SAME raw data
- Users can verify data themselves via IPFS
- Debate shifts from "who to trust" to "how to interpret"

**Impact**: Makes data provenance transparent, focuses debate on interpretation

---

## 4. Product Safety Recalls

### Problem
Product approved → Years later, safety issues emerge → Hard to track which products affected

### Truth Mesh Solution
- FDA approval stored as Core Fact (signature, timestamp)
- Later safety warnings added as new Core Facts
- Product interpretation confidence decays automatically
- Users searching product see full timeline:
  - 2018: 95% confidence (approved)
  - 2020: 90% confidence (minor warnings)
  - 2022: 60% confidence (class-action lawsuit)
  - 2024: 30% confidence (recall issued)

**Impact**: Temporal honesty - claims lose confidence when not re-verified

---

## 5. Historical Revisions

### Problem
Wikipedia article on controversial topic → Edit wars → One side "wins" → Other perspective suppressed

### Truth Mesh Solution
- Historical event stored as Core Facts (dates, documents, archives)
- Multiple interpretations maintained as forks:
  - Progressive interpretation
  - Conservative interpretation
  - Academic interpretation
- No edit wars - all forks coexist
- Users choose which lens to view through
- Diff view shows exact differences between interpretations

**Impact**: Ends zero-sum battles over "the truth"

---

## 6. Drug Efficacy Studies

### Problem
Pharmaceutical company funds study → Shows drug effective → Independent studies show mixed results → Confusion

### Truth Mesh Solution
- Company study tagged with "corporate-funded" bias label
- Independent studies tagged with "academic" or "government"
- Funding sources transparent in all interpretations
- Meta-analysis shows confidence over time
- If new contradictory evidence emerges, confidence decays
- Users see full picture, not just company marketing

**Impact**: Makes funding bias explicit, reduces selective reporting

---

## 7. Misinformation Tracking

### Problem
False claim spreads → Debunked → But original claim still circulating → No easy way to track

### Truth Mesh Solution
- False claim stored as Interpretation (not Core Fact)
- Challenge submitted with debunking evidence
- Community votes on challenge (reputation-weighted)
- If accepted, confidence drops to near-zero
- Original claim still visible (not deleted) but flagged as discredited
- Users searching claim see full dispute history

**Impact**: Prevents Streisand effect (deleting claims makes them seem censored)

---

## 8. Journalistic Corrections

### Problem
News article published → Later corrected → Many readers saw original, not correction

### Truth Mesh Solution
- Original article stored with timestamp
- Correction added as new version
- Readers see notification: "Article updated - see what changed"
- Diff view shows exact changes
- Confidence score reflects correction history
- Journalists with consistent accuracy earn reputation

**Impact**: Makes corrections visible, rewards accuracy

---

## 9. Academic Peer Review

### Problem
Paper submitted → Peer reviewed → Accepted/rejected → Reviews not public → Hard to assess quality

### Truth Mesh Solution
- Paper stored as Interpretation
- Peer reviews stored as Challenges
- Reviews can be public or anonymous (author choice)
- Community can add post-publication reviews
- Reputation system shows reviewer track record
- Papers with high-quality reviews earn higher confidence

**Impact**: Makes peer review transparent and post-publication

---

## 10. Legal Precedents

### Problem
Court ruling → Later overturned → Lawyers citing old precedent → Need to track validity

### Truth Mesh Solution
- Ruling stored as Core Fact (court signature, case number)
- Later rulings that modify/overturn stored as new Facts
- Legal interpretations show confidence over time
- Lawyers see if precedent still valid
- Full citation chain from original to latest ruling

**Impact**: Legal research with temporal validity built-in

---

## How These Patterns Generalize

**All use cases share common themes:**

1. **Immutable Record**: Core facts never deleted, only reinterpreted
2. **Multiple Lenses**: Competing interpretations coexist
3. **Temporal Honesty**: Confidence decays without re-verification
4. **Provenance**: Full chain from claim to source to original data
5. **Reputation**: Trust earned through accuracy, not authority
6. **Fork-ability**: Communities maintain their own versions
